# Homeassistant Dashbox Forwarding
A (quickly) converted chat server example to take in GEM packets and forward it to the DashBox/Home-Assistant while allowing Home-Assistant to still talk with the GEM.  

This script runs on whatever is hosting your instance of Home-Assistant.

- Replace the values at the top of the file with your Home-Assistant and DashBox Server values.
- Set the GEM to send to the ip/port specified in the file.
